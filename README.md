The chivalrous messenger god is here to reduce your burden of Digital Publicity of your college events in facebook groups.

## Motivation

With every new event in college or any organisation, comes the burden of making it spread organically through facebook. A great way to do this is by posting it in multiple groups. It is a very tiresome and repetative task which can be excruciating at times.

## Features

- Allow posting in multiple groups by providing the list of groups and the required content.
- Accept list and content in multiple formats.
- Allow posting for two types of posts: embed and non embed.
- Create a installable pip package for the same.
- Secure and doesn't take password beyond user's system.

## Schedule

#### Phase I

Explore all the options and the tools required to accomplish the same. Get a knowledge of the DOM structure of Facebook.

#### Phase II

Create a basic structure for the project and implement the extracting and selection of DOM objects required for the process. Acceptance of input and formatting it should also be completed.

#### Phase III

Make it a pip package and finish up the coding phase. Write tests if time remains.
