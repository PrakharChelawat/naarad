- Accept list and content in multiple formats.
- Allow posting for two types of posts: embed and non embed.
- Create a installable pip package for the same.
- Secure and doesn't take password beyond user's system.

## Schedule

#### Phase I

Explore all the options and the tools required to accomplish the same. Get a knowledge of the DOM structure of Facebook.

#### Phase II

Create a basic structure for the project and implement the extracting and selection of DOM objects required for the process. Acceptance of input and formatting it should also be completed.
